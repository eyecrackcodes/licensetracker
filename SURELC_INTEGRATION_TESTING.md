# SureLC API Integration Testing Results

## Summary

We've implemented the SureLC Producer API integration for license tracking automation, with a key discovery - the API works better with SSN than with NPN.

## Current Implementation

1. **API Client**: Created in `src/utils/sureLcApi.ts` to interface with the SureLC API using both SSN and NPN methods
2. **Data Synchronization**: Added functions in `src/services/dataService.ts` to sync licenses with fallback logic
3. **Scheduled Tasks**: Created in `src/utils/scheduledTasks.ts` for running the update
4. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Added in `.github/workflows/license-update.yml` to run the update daily
5. **Manual Testing Scripts**: Created multiple scripts to test various SureLC API endpoints

## Testing Results

Extensive API testing revealed:

1. **API Authentication**: The credentials are valid (no 401 Unauthorized errors)

2. **SSN API Works**: We can identify producers by SSN with these patterns:
   - `123456789` → Producer exists (ID: 973771) but you don't have licenses access 
   - `555555555` → Producer exists (ID: 1056) but you don't have licenses access
   - `012345678` → Producer exists (ID: 72482) but you don't have licenses access
   - `111111111` → Producer exists but is not associated with your agency (ID: 586)

3. **Limited Access**: Your account has the following limitations:
   - Cannot access producer details via NPN endpoints (permission issues)
   - Cannot access licenses via NPN endpoints (permission issues)
   - Cannot access producer details directly, even with producer ID
   - Can identify producers by SSN, but lacks permission to view their licenses

## Next Steps

To complete the integration:

1. **Contact SureLC Support**: You need to:
   - Provide your account information (jonathan.kaiser@luminarylife.com)
   - Explain that you're getting 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access producer licenses
   - Request the ROLE_AGENCY or ROLE_CARRIER permission needed for license data access
   - Mention you're Agency ID 586 in their system
   - Specifically mention the producerIds you found (973771, 1056, 72482) as examples

2. **Update Producer Data**: Add SSN field to producer records:
   - Update your UI to allow entering/storing SSN (with appropriate security)
   - The integration will now use SSN first, with NPN as fallback
   - Both methods require proper API permissions

3. **Test with Valid SSNs**: Once permissions are granted:
   - Update the `scripts/test-surelc-ssn.js` script with real producer SSNs
   - Run the script to verify access: `node scripts/test-surelc-ssn.js`

4. **Update GitHub Secrets**: Before pushing the GitHub workflow to production, add your Firebase credentials as repository secrets:
   - FIREBASE_API_KEY
   - FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
   - FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL
   - FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   - FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
   - FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
   - FIREBASE_APP_ID

5. **Manual License Update**: Once you have proper access, you can run the license update manually:

   ```bash
   npm run update-licenses
   ```

## Summary of API Access Issues

After extensive testing, we determined that:

1. Your account authenticates successfully to the SureLC API
2. Your account is associated with Agency ID 586
3. Your account can identify producers by SSN
4. Your account lacks permission to see producer licenses
5. The interface needs to be updated to use SSN instead of NPN

## Credentials

For security reasons, update the implementation to retrieve API credentials from environment variables only, removing hardcoded credentials before pushing to a public repository.
